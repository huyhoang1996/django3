            <p>Nowaday, clients use lots of applications and websites, which make a
                 concerning problem about complicated authentication. 
                 People do not waste time creating and signing on these platforms repeatedly. 
                 Developers recognize that Oauth is essential. From my viewpoint, 
                 I am persuaded that Oauth can help customers access multiple applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin with, OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for authentication and 
                authorization which is used to provide single sign-on (SSO). 
                SSO is a form term used to describe a scenario in which a user uses 
                the same credentials to log in various domains. People can take in detail 
                SSO in https://www.miniorange.com/single-sign-on-sso or in my other posts. There, I pay attention to Oauth, 
                especially Oauth2, which are extremely helpful in developing API services.
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, Oauth2 is more popular than Oauth. In reality, Oauth is really complicated and is not essential for authentication. If developers just verify to access multiple applications, Oauth2 is sufficient security. For example, expressing workflow Oauth is that.
            </p>

              <img class="minio-image center" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/oauth.png" alt="Oauth"/>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              As you see, this process has 8 steps, which is tough for developers. Hence, Oauth2 is more useful with only 6 steps 
            </p>
            <p>
              <img class="minio-image center" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/oauth2-workflow.png" alt="Oauth2"/>
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              As you see, I can predict common questions like Why need authorization grant?,  why not return access grant at first? I will reply in the next post.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, giant technology companies have just Oauth2  and have written detail documents. For example, developers can figure out on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/  and https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2 . Clarify to waste time, I can only express a general flow like this 
            </p>
            <p>
              <img class="minio-image center" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/google-facebook.png" alt="Oauth2"/>
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <p>To prevent a long post. I will describe a tutorial in next post.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, developers have a deep understand Oauth about meaning and workflow. I believe that Oauth will bring more advantages to access multi platforms.
